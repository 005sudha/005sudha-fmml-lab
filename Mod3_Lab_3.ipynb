        "The TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) approach generally results in better accuracy compared to the Bag-of-Words (BoW) model because it addresses some of the key limitations of BoW by considering not just the presence or frequency of words but also their relative importance in a corpus.

        "Both stemming and lemmatization have their place in text preprocessing, and the choice depends on the application's requirements. For modern NLP tasks, lemmatization is generally preferred due to its accuracy, especially when combined with advanced techniques like word embeddings or transformer-based models. However, stemming remains a practical choice for speed-critical or resource-constrained tasks."
